# Customer Revenue KPI Analysis (SQL)

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates revenue performance, customer retention, and operational efficiency using retail transaction data.

Key findings:
- Total revenue: 28,609.93 across 72 orders.
- Repeat customer rate is 4.35%, indicating weak customer retention.
- Revenue shows volatility with spikes in late 2016.
- Furniture drives the highest revenue across most regions.
- Standard shipping averages 5.09 days, more than double First Class (2.19 days).

The business appears revenue-generating but retention-poor, with potential operational optimization opportunities.
